    <a class="descript"> Hello, my name is Ivan Yakubovich. I am a first-year CS Major from New Jersey. I've always been passionate about helping the less fortunate through construction and remodeling. From a young age, I volunteered at a construction company and remodeled 15 apartments to improve the living conditions of residents. I hope to translate this positive impact upon others through coding and tech. </a>
